<p>Micro plastics are now in our foods and since they are not biodegradable, we are yet to understand their health consequences problem has become more rampant in the 21 century globally because the consumerism nature we are encouraged to live by. Yet fortunately for us in a digitized 21 century we are able to come up with a solution that starts to tackle the issue as well as involve the citizens as stakeholders in the solution. 
The solution here then is the development of an app that allows us to take a picture of rubbish dumped illegally with the geographic location embedded to be sent to the authorities to help take action by receiving the information and taking steps to clear the rubbish. If one is caught in the act as well of dumping rubbish where they shouldn't such photograph information loaded up on the app will help in identifying the culprit and possibly prosecuting to deter others from doing the same. 
A Clean Ghana App then will work to help reduce the waste pollution epidemic in the country. Pictures such as the ones that follow this write up are examples of the current situation and why the app will help deliver the information to the authorities that have been vested to act once they get the information.
